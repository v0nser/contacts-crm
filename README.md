# **Contact Management System**

---

## **Project Description**
The **Contact Management System** is a web application for managing a contact database. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact data, featuring a responsive UI built with **ReactJS** and **Material-UI (MUI)** and a backend powered by **Node.js** and **Express**.

---

## **Key Features**
- Add, view, update, and delete contacts with ease.
- Paginated and sortable contact table for better organization.
- Modern and responsive design using Material-UI.
- RESTful APIs for seamless backend communication.

---

## **Technical Overview**

### **Frontend**
- Built with **ReactJS** and **Material-UI**.
- **React Router** for client-side routing.
- State management with `useState` and `useEffect`.

### **Backend**
- Developed with **Node.js** and **Express**.
- API Endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Error handling for robust performance.

### **Database**
- **MongoDB** used for storing contact data.
- Schema-free structure allows flexibility.

## **Major Technical Decisions**
1. **Lightweight Stack**: Using ReactJS and Node.js ensures fast development and performance.
2. **Material-UI**: Consistent and customizable UI components.
3. **REST API**: Simplicity and compatibility with future integrations.
4. **Local State**: Chosen over Redux for this projectâ€™s scope.
